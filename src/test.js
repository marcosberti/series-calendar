        '<p>The new animated series, <b>Alvinnn!!! and the Chipmunks</b> will take viewers on a roller-coaster ride of music, laughter and stories geared to entertain four generations of "The Chipmunks" fans. Presented for the first time in glorious CGI, the series features ground-breaking animation and a new, original Chipmunk song in every episode. The series is an animated version of a prime-time sitcom and reflects the trials and tribulations of a single parent, David Seville, trying to raise six hyper-active Chipmunks. Like most parents, Dave\'s patience will be pushed to the limit, forcing him to end most sentences in "ALVINNN!!!"</p><p>Alvin, Simon and Theodore are brothers who tour the world as famous rock stars and still manage to go to school. Completely normal... right? Did I also mention that they\'re Chipmunks? Along with their best friends, The Chipettes, Alvin and his chipmunk brothers cause tons of trouble on and off the stage while their dad, Dave, tries to manage these three rambunctious rodents, while writing all of their hit songs. Alvin, Theodore, and Simon are so different, it\'s hard to believe that they came from the same litter. With little voices and BIG personalities, there will be no shortage of adventures when these Chipmunks hit the stage!</p>',

        "<p>Each year, approximately 16,000 people are murdered in the United States. 7% of the killers are female.*</p><p>Who are these women and what drives them to kill? Oxygen's hit true crime series, <i>Snapped</i>, profiles the fascinating cases of women accused of murder. Did they really do it? And, if they did, why? Whether the motivation was revenge against a cheating husband, the promise of a hefty insurance payoff, or putting an end to years of abuse, the reasons are as varied as the women themselves. From socialites to secretaries, female killers share one thing in common: at some point, they all snapped. <b>Snapped </b>is produced in conjunction with Jupiter Entertainment, the creators of <i>City Confidential</i> and <i>Dominick Dunne's Power</i>, <i>Privilege &amp; Justice</i>, and narrated by veteran news reporter Sharon Martin. Each episode of <i>Snapped</i> chronicles the life of a woman who has been charged with murder. These shocking but true stories turn common assumptions about crime and criminals upside down, and prove that even the most unlikely suspects can be capable of murder.</p>",

Each year the awards are presented during a live telecast that was begun in 1971 by ABC, but has since been televised by CBS after they bought it in 1973. They were initially known as the Gramophone Awards this is because the trophy itself is a golden gramophone but later they became the Grammys.</p>",

        "<p><b>90 Day Fiancé</b> offers a unique look into the world of international dating and matrimony. Using a unique 90-day fiance visa, the K-1 visa, four women and two men will travel to the U.S. to live with their overseas partners for the first time. The couples must marry before their visas expire in 90 days, or the visiting partner will have to return home. They'll have to overcome language barriers, culture shock and skeptical friends and family -- all with a clock that starts ticking the moment they step foot on U.S. soil. The stakes are incredibly high as these couples are forced to make a life-altering decision: get married or send their international mate home.</p>",

The show explores how they were designed, built, used, and in some cases, lost and rediscovered. At critical points in each episode, stunning \"blow apart\" CGI animation deconstructs the structures to reveal hidden anatomy while exploring the secret history of each edifice, immersing us in the age and culture in which they were constructed.</p><p>Archeologists travel to various parts of the world, in search of ancient secrets of mysterious civilizations. From the tallest pyramids to an underwater city, experts take viewers on an unforgettable journey.</p><p>Unearthed fuses elements of engineering, history, geology, and archaeology, revealing the deepest secrets of each structure. We'll see the latest technology used to solve mysteries such as how the Parthenon still stands against earthquakes; how sticky rice was used to build the Great Wall of China; and what sacred secret lies beneath the Mayan temples of Chichen Itza.</p><p>They may be older structures, but scientists and archaeologists use the latest technology including LiDAR scanning, X-ray imaging, carbon dating, and 3D printing techniques to reveal secrets of the past in ways that weren't possible before. Unearthed shows the future of science and technology are key to understanding our past, and without these developments, we wouldn't be able to unravel some of the world's greatest mysteries.</p>",
